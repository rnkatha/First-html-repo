    <h2>School</h2>
    <p> Started in the late 90s and went through the 844 system that was present then. Done with primary school and joined a neighbourhood school.Weeh! This is the life I would never ever want to rewind. What was that honestly?*crying emoji* Nevertheless, I pulled through and joined a city uni, the only uni that starts with an article. You get the gist?<br> Long story short, graduation happened but still schooling happens every day because, life. Life teaches you every day.</p>

<section id="Work">
    <h2>Work</h2>
    <p> Getting a job opportunity is Kenya is and has never been easy after the government stopped absorbing all graduates directly into the market in the 1990s. Since then, this has been a struggle and will be for a while.<br> Now, through thick and thin, one thing I told myself is to keep pushing. If the journey gets tough, take a break and try again tomorrow or the day after. This mantra has kept me going for the longest. Not giving up. Offered my services for simsim for a while before God opened a project door for me and later gave me this opportunity that I'm currently thriving in. Grateful.</p>

    <h2>Projects</h2>
    <p> Having a project(s) is such a flex because <br>
        <ol>
            <li> You get to manage your time</li>
           <li>You plan about the future</li> 
           <li>You avoid wastages</li>
           <li>You get to enjoy life etc</li>
        </ol>
        
        Below are some of the projects that I'm continuously working on because planning issa must!

    <ul>
        <li>Travelling.<br> Get out and go see the world. Have seen these interviews online where old folks say if there is one thing they would have done more while young is to travel, locally and internationally. It's an expensive venture but with the few coins I accumulate I try to. I'm just starting and Vasha sounds like a plan! Haha</li>
        <li>Building.<br>Where you come back home after you travels, have a place to rest and catch a breather as you plan you next trip. A place where you can call home with zero worries of you having rent reminders every end of the month.Top tier this one </li>
        <li>Financial Investment.<br> It is very broad topic. Saccos or banks? treasury bills or bonds or money markets? On this one I'm as confused as many peers out here but hoping soon enough I will crack it and make the most from it all. </li>
    </ul>
